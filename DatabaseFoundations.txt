Video 1: Relational Databases (2 min)
Relational- organizes data into relations (set of columns of related data)
Ex: List of customers (Customer = Entity), shared attributes (name, email, phone number)
Tables - set of columns and contains rows (Have a defined type); Column data type

Video 2: Keys and Unique Values (2 min)
Read and access data in database. Unique values appear only once in a column. 
Primary Key, Synthetic/Surrogate Key, Composite Key, Foreign Key

Video 3: Relationships (2 min)
3 types- 1) One to many, 2) many to many, 3) one to one
*One to many is most common

*One to one relationship - (Not as common) only 1 record on 1 table to another record on annother table

Video 4: ACID and Transactions (3 min)
Transaction example
ACID- Atomic, Consistent, Isolated, Durable
*Characteristics of transactions

Video 5: Basic SQL (4 min)
SQL- Structured Querey Language
RDBMS (Relational Database Management System) Support SQL
SQL- data manipulation Language
*data definition
SQL statement- clause, predicate, expression

"Show me the first name and last name for every record in the Customers table please"

Ex: SELECT FirstName, LastName FROM Customers;
                                    (field)

6. A unique value _____.

    -Image would have a horizontal row entirely shaded
10. Which is a good example of a candidate key?
    -an employee ID number
    (Any piece of data that uniquely represents a row is a candidate key, and if you have a value that occurs in the data naturally, that's a natural key.)
